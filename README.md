# HBC Student Night 2025 https://hbc-student-night.vercel.app/
Welcome! You've stumbled on the GitHub repo of HBC Student Night's event programme. This was a student event held in Turku in January 2025. 🏟️

## Content
The site contains all the necessary information for the event partakers. The pages include:
* **Club**: Information about the organizers, Hunks Basketball Club 🏀
* **Rosters**: The squads for the game 👥
* **Game preview**: Statistics and comments leading up to the game 💬
* **After party**: Information about the after party of the game 🎉

## Tech
This a Vite+React frontend-only project hosted on Vercel. The styles are made with Sass.

## Design
This was my first go at mobile-first website design. I'm super pleased as the final dev result looks almost identical with the design!
